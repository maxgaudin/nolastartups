      <h2>Wondering WTF some of those startup terms mean?</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Product terms</h3>

      <h5>SaaS</h5>
      <p>Software as a service. These are web products that you pay for usually on a monthly basis to have access to. Rather than downloading something and owning it forever you only have access as long as you are paying. Some examples are Highrise CRM and Rdio.</p>
      <h5>Lifetime Value of a Customer</h5>
      <p>This number helps you figure out how much business you'll get out of your average customer. The equation is: (Average Value of a Sale) X (Number of Repeat Transactions) X (Average Retention Time in Months or Years for a Typical Customer). If you charge $10 a month for you product and the typical customer uses it for two years that customer is worth $240 to your company.</p>
      <h5>Responsive design</h5>
      <p>A term in web design that means your site will adjust its dimensions automatically depending on the device that it is being viewed on. This website is responsive. If you reduce the width of your browser you can see it changes accordingly. </p>
      <h5>Native app vs. Web app</h5>
      <p>If it's something you can download from an app store then it is native. This typically means downloading something from the iOS app store for iPhones or Google Play store for Android devices. A web app is basically a website that is accessible through the browser.</p>
      <h5>A/B testing</h5>
      <p>A/B testing lets you randomly show users two different version of the same page. This is valuable because you can see which version of your page converts into more of your goals being reached. The most typical goal would be having a user sign up for your service. You may find, for instance, that the version with a video of your product converts better. </p>

      <h3>Investing</h3>
      <h5>Equity</h5>
      <p>Equity is what chunk of a company you own and in terms of funding what you give up in exchange for raising capital from investors.</p>
      <h5>Vesting</h5>
      <p>Vesting is when you get your equity over a predetermind amount of time. It's something that both founders and employees should partake in. The reason for this is so that someone who owns 20% of the company can't leave with their full amount of equity after 3 months of working. </p>
      <h5>Cliffs</h5>
      <p>Startups often give employees a cliff where they don't actually get any equity until a certain amount of time. A typical cliff is one year. If I am supposed to get 4% vested over 4 years but I leave after 8 months I get nothing. After one year I will get the full 1% I am owed.</p>

      <h3>Communities, etc.</h3>
      <h5>AngelList</h5>
      <p><a href="http://angel.co/">AngeList</a> is like LinkedIn but just for startups and way cooler. If you're a startup you need to have a profile on there especially if you're looking to raise funding since you can do that directly on their website. </p>
      <h5>Reddit</h5>
      <p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> calls itself the front page of the internet. It is not one giant community but rather a collection of "sub" reddits which are all their own communities. Reddit can be very valuable from a startup perspective if there's a community on there relevant to what you do. At the very least check out <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/startups">r/startups</a> and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/entrepreneur">entrepreneur</a></p>
      <h5>Hacker News</h5>
      <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> is a news aggregator that caters to programmers and entrepreneurs and is a product of Y Combinator.</p>


      <h5>Bitcoin</h5>
      <p>Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.</p>
