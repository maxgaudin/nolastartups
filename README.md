============

A simple resource for the New Orleans startup community. 

This site aims to be a straightforward resource for people to get a breakdown of the various organizations and meetups that make up the New Orleans startup ecosystem. There are currently three main sections: the front page with resources, an event calendar and glossary of common startup terms.
