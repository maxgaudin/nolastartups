      <h3>How to start a business in New Orleans</h3>
      <p>This is a guide on how to start a business in New Orleans. If you need to have a storefront or physically interact with customers you should also refer to the city's <a href="http://www.nola.gov/onestop/business/">One Stop Shop</a> section.</p>


      <p>First things first:</p>
      <p><strong>Come up with a good name</strong>. This is really important and not to be taken lightly. Some advice is to keep it to two syllables so it's easy to remember and try to keep it relevant to your industry. A good example is Instacart: they quickly deliver groceries to your door. Checkout <a href="http://thenextweb.com/entrepreneur/2012/04/22/before-naming-your-startup-read-this/">this article</a> from The Next Web for further reading.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Buy a domain name, reserve social media accounts</strong>. If you want to keep it cheap you can get it down to $2 with promo codes on Godaddy. If you're not ready to setup the website use <a href="http://launchrock.co/">Launchrock</a>. If you're ready to build a website but aren't tech savvy consider Weebly or Squarespace. If you are tech savvy you can set at static site up for free with Github Pages. Keep it simple and give people an easy way to contact you. Users should understand what you do within 10 seconds of hitting your page.</p> 

      <p>While it's generally recommended that you incorporate immediately you don't really have to do so until it's truly necessary. </p>

      <p>What makes it necessary? When you need to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>open a bank account</li>
        <li>hire employees</li>
        <li>formally issue equity</li>
        <li>perform some other action that requires the existence of a corporation: business permits, working with vendors, etc.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Generally if you're physically working with people such as a delivery business or selling physical products you should incorporate immediately to protect yourself. If you're developing a web-based product and aren't generating revenue just yet you can hold off.</p>

      <h4>Forming a business in Louisiana</h4>
      <p>This is actually really easy and can be done online in 5 minutes. Most people seem to start out with LLCs. If you're unsure you should consult a lawyer or checkout the <a href="http://www.sba.gov/category/navigation-structure/starting-managing-business/starting-business/choose-your-business-stru">SBA's site</a>.</p>

      <p>What you'll need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A name that is not taken</li>
        <li>An address for the business. (This can be a home address if needed)</li>
        <li>Names and addresses of members</li>
        <li>$100 payable via credit card</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Make sure to save your articles of incorporation for future reference.</p>

      <p>Also ensure you and your cofounders are all members. You might accidentally list someone as a registered agent rather than a member. The registered agent is someone who is submitting the articles of incorporation on your behalf such as an attorney.</p>

      <a class="button" href="http://www.sos.la.gov/BusinessServices/FileBusinessDocuments/FileOriginalDocuments/Pages/default.aspx">Form your company here</a>

      <p>If you're incorporating and have cofounders it is <strong>highly recommended</strong> that you hire a lawyer to write an operating agreement. You should do this to handle, among other things, the four D's down the line: death, divorce, disability, and dissolution. It helps ensure your company is operating with a solid foundation moving forward. You can always refer to the operating agreement when various conflicts arise.</p>

      <h4>Opening a bank account</h4>
      <p>Opening a checking accont is pretty straightforward although banks will tend to waste your time by keeping you in there and trying to upsell you on their services because that's how they operate. </p>

      <p>What you'll need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Articles of incorporation - you get these when registering your business with the state</li>
        <li>An EIN (employee identification number) - get this free from the IRS <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Apply-for-an-Employer-Identification-Number-(EIN)-Online">here</a></li>
        <li>Your social security number and driver's license</li>
        <li>Minium deposit - usually $100 but you can sometimes start out with somehthing lower if you're nice</li>
        <li>The capacity to accept or tolerate delay, trouble, or suffering without getting angry or upset...AKA patience.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Recommended local banks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.iberiabank.com/">Iberia Bank</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.gulfbank.com/">Gulf Coast Bank and Trust</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.gnofcu.com/">GNO Federal Credit Union</a></li>
      </ul>
